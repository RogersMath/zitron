The transformer paper was published in 2017, ChatGPT launched in 2022. 79% of Americans have heard of ChatGPT, 34% have used it. 33% of global VC funding went to AI in 2024. These companies have unlimited resources and attention but still can't create meaningful use cases.</td>

Unlike fiber optic cables with varied uses, AI GPUs are limited by CUDA and designed for one specific function. This wasn't an infrastructure buildout but a centralized asset bubble.</td>
